I teach with an emphasis on ear training and self expression, all ages and skill levels are welcome! There is an athletic side (getting your muscle memory in shape) and an artistic side (getting your creativity flowing) to learning an instrument. We will work at both, and the homework will be equal parts listening and playing. I offer local lessons at flexible rates. Send me a note with your name, brief musical background (including your favorite artists), and what youâ€™re looking to work on.
