I‚Äôm a classically trained fiddle player. After studying classical violin performance at New England Conservatory and UMass Amherst, I stopped altogether for a number of years and became an interdisciplinary visual artist. I moved to Providence in 2013 to join a live/work artist cooperative at AS220 and shortly thereafter I started playing in a local avant garde classical ensemble called the Providence Research Ensemble. Through friendship and collaboration I gradually learned how to improvise across many different genres.

While living in NYC I played bass, fiddle and sang in the country music backing band for Dougie Poole, and also became a member of the experimental Baroque ensemble COTC. I currently perform, record and tour with The Infinity Ring, a post-rock folk metal project, and in Dakou Dakou, another noisy 5-7 person ensemble with a Chinese folk influence. You can also find me at the local Irish pub sitting in on sessions from time to time üôÇ

Tarantula Fiddle is a nod to Italian folklore and the Tarantella, a fiddler‚Äôs cure for snakebite. This project aims to incorporate fiddle, dance, improvisation and deep listening into a holistic music practice. In the words of Albert Ayler, ‚ÄúMusic is the healing force of the universe.‚Äù
